# ts-authorizer
Automated generation of Aserto Authorizer TypeScript type definitions.

## Consuming the definitions
These definitions can be consumed by `yarn` directly from `git` using the following reference:
```
"devDependencies": {
    "@aserto/ts-authorizer": "git+https://github.com/aserto-dev/ts-authorizer.git#v0.0.1",
```

Replace `v0.0.1` with the tag you would like to use.
